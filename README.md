### Earthlings, this is Mateus Evangelista 👽

My journey in technology commenced in 2017, at the age of 14, during a technical course in computer networks. There, I had my first encounter with Java programming. Since then, my passion for this limitless field has only grown. Currently, I contribute to ASC Brazil's development sector in the flows department.
